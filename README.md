🚀 AI-Based Job & Skill Matcher
AI/ML Project | NLP | Skill Gap Analysis | Career Intelligence System

An end-to-end AI system that analyzes resumes using Natural Language Processing (NLP), compares extracted skills with industry job descriptions, and generates personalized upskilling recommendations.

This project demonstrates applied NLP, information extraction, web scraping, and intelligent recommendation system design.

🎯 Project Motivation

Recruiters evaluate candidates based on job-specific skills, yet many students lack clarity on their skill gaps. This system uses data-driven analysis to:

Extract structured skill data from unstructured resumes

Analyze real-world job descriptions

Perform skill-gap computation

Recommend targeted learning pathways

It converts resume text into actionable career insights using AI techniques.

🧠 Technical Architecture
1️⃣ Resume Parsing & NLP Pipeline

Text extraction from PDF/DOCX

Preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization

Skill extraction using:

Rule-based matching

Custom skill dictionary

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Feature engineering using TF-IDF / keyword matching

2️⃣ Job Description Mining

Web scraping (BeautifulSoup / Selenium)

Text cleaning & normalization

Skill frequency analysis

Industry trend identification

3️⃣ Skill Gap Analysis Engine

Vector-based similarity comparison

Skill set difference computation

Ranking missing skills by demand frequency

Cosine similarity for resume-job match score

4️⃣ Recommendation System

Rule-based + keyword-mapped course suggestions

Structured output:

Matching Skills

Missing Skills

Priority Learning Areas
