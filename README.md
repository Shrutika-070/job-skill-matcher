## 📌 Overview

An end-to-end **AI-powered career intelligence system** that:

- 📄 Extracts skills from resumes using NLP  
- 💼 Analyzes real-time job descriptions  
- 📊 Performs skill-gap comparison  
- 📚 Recommends personalized learning resources  

This project demonstrates applied **Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Web Scraping, and Recommendation System design**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students often lack clarity about:
- Required skills for target job roles  
- Why their resumes get rejected  
- What they should learn next  

This system transforms **unstructured resume text** into **actionable career insights** using AI techniques.

---

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

### 🔹 1. Resume Parsing & NLP Pipeline
- PDF/DOCX text extraction  
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
- Skill extraction using:
  - Custom skill dictionary  
  - Rule-based matching  
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- Feature engineering using TF-IDF  

---

### 🔹 2. Job Description Mining
- Web scraping (BeautifulSoup / Selenium)  
- Text normalization & cleaning  
- Skill frequency analysis  
- Industry demand trend identification  

---

### 🔹 3. Skill Gap Analysis Engine
- Resume vs Job skill comparison  
- Cosine similarity scoring  
- Demand-based ranking of missing skills  
- Resume-job match percentage calculation  

---

### 🔹 4. Recommendation System
- Rule-based course mapping  
- Personalized learning roadmap generation  
- Structured output:
  - ✅ Matching Skills  
  - ❌ Missing Skills  
  - ⚠️ High-Priority Skills
